## The model:
Bibliography:
[The Abelian sandpile model of Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.38.364)


## Compilation:
compilation: g++ BTW.
The code by default performs a simulation on a 501X501 grid droping sand grains deterministically at the position (251,251).

## Launch:
You can run the program with default parameters simply by executing after the compilation:

./a.out
